# Ember Components Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  Give an example of a visual hierarchy that could be modeled with components. Explain why each piece might be it's own component.

    ```md
    Components can model a number of things. A good example is a navbar containing
    buttons or links
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a new component called '`my-map`'?

    ```sh
    ember generate component my-map
    ```

1.  What files are created and/or edited to produce a component, and what are their responsibilities?

    ```md
    Template.hbs and component.js are edited to produce a component. Template files
    are responsible for defining structure and binding data, while component files
    are responsible for behavior.
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a component '`my-contact`', which is loaded from
    '`app/contacts/template.hbs`' when visiting the `/contacts` route. What is
    the syntax (code that is written) to render this component inside that template?

    ```html
    {{each model as |contact|}}
    {{my-contact contact=contact}}
    {{/each}}
    ```

1.  Each contact has multiple phone numbers. Suppose you also have '`my-phone`'
    nested under '`my-contact`'. What is the code you would write in
    '`app/components/my-contact/template.hbs`' to load the nested component and
    pass it data?

    ```html
    {{each contact.phones as |phone|}}
    {{my-phone phone=phone}}
    {{/each}}
    ```
